## About me

  Since 2019 I graduated from the University of St. Petersburg State University of Technology and since this year I work in the companies of JSC "Uzbektelecom" as an engineer in the field of Convergent Billing systems, the main activity was the analysis of system errors and printed forms of the Billing system. For me it is always interesting to study and achieve new goals, so I decided to study programming, namely Front-End, because it is always interesting to see my specialty right after writing the code. Everyone says that programming is a difficult profession, but all famous programmers started their first code with the words *"Hello World!"*
